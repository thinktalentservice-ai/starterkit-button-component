    //
    // They also go on <html>, and that placement is load-bearing rather than
    // belt-and-braces. styles.css carries a `prefers-color-scheme: light`
    // fallback guarded by `:root:not([data-mui-color-scheme]):not([data-theme])`
    // for hosts that declare no scheme at all. With the attributes only on this
    // wrapper div, <html> still has neither — so on a machine whose OS
    // preference is light, that block would match and paint light tokens onto
    // every .ib-btn in DARK mode. Writing them to the root makes the guard fail,
    // which is the whole point of the guard.
    //
    // `data-scheme` is separate and workshop-only: preview.css keys the canvas
    // and the docs-block background off it.
    // `data-brand` rides along on the same two elements for the same reason,
    // with one extra constraint: brands.generated.css scopes each preset's
    // light block as `[data-brand="x"][data-mui-color-scheme="light"]` — a
    // COMPOUND selector, both attributes on ONE element. <html> carries both,
    // so it matches. The wrapper div carries both, so it matches too. Splitting
    // them across the two would silently serve dark brand tokens in light mode.

      // always re-run the `color` transition that depends on it, so a solid
      // button can keep the previous brand's label ink indefinitely while its
      // gradient updates. Measured: after switching Think -> Elemetrik,
      // --ib-on-solid reads #fff while getComputedStyle(...).color still reads
      // rgb(11,15,25); a freshly cloned copy of the very same element in the
      // very same document computes #fff. New elements are correct, stale ones
      // are not — so remount them.
